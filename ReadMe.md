# Nim Braces

Nim-Braces is a binary that allows you to write valid nim code with braces
This helps remove the need for whitespace indentation* and helps people transition from braces indentation -> nim's whitespace indentation

*NOTE: it is still recommended you use normal nim whitespace indentation of 2 spaces when structuring your code,
       this transpiler does not enforce indentation it uses the indentation that is already placed in the file
       also make sure there is a space between an opening brace and the end of the if/while/proc definition

## Running
for help run nim_braces --help
